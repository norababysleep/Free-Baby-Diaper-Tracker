            <h2>Expert Parenting Tips for Diaper Tracking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Newborn norms:</strong> Expect 1–2 dirty diapers in days 1–2, increasing to 3–4+ yellow, seedy stools by day 5.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration check:</strong> Pale yellow urine = well-hydrated. Dark yellow or pink-tinged may need more feeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Night changes:</strong> You don’t need to wake a sleeping baby for a wet diaper—log it in the morning with time adjusted.</li>
                <li><strong>Diaper rash:</strong> If skin is red, apply zinc oxide cream and log frequency to spot triggers.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula vs. breastfed:</strong> Formula-fed babies often have fewer, firmer stools. Both are normal!</li>
                <li><strong>Track for 48 hours:</strong> Before calling the pediatrician, log patterns for 2 full days to show trends.</li>
                <li><strong>Share with partners:</strong> Both parents can use this tool—just bookmark the page on your phones.</li>
                <li><strong>Use notes wisely:</strong> “Green, watery x3” is more helpful than “diarrhea” when reviewing with a doctor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Can I overfeed a breastfed baby?</h3>
